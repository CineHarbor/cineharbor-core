# Strict Rust quality checkpoint — 2026-09-19

Observed source baseline: `0de339fcd36427fbd9d3d5485949d8ec4c672f93`. Project identity, selected lineage, Core/Profile and operations provenance are unchanged. The Principal authorized these code/CI repairs and commits as part of 1.0.0 release preparation; public release is excluded.

## Validation performed

The isolated test environment was materialized from locked source dependencies by facade Actions run `35418243801`; artifact checksums were verified before use. Rust/rustfmt/clippy 1.98.1 and matching wasm-bindgen CLI 0.2.126 were used. Local source directories are temporary Git mirrors for reviewed patch generation, not remote repository identities.

- `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features --locked --offline -- -D warnings`: pass. Diagnostic collection without `-D warnings` was used only to enumerate issues; it was not accepted as a gate.
- `cargo test --workspace --all-targets --all-features --locked --offline`: 161 passed, zero failed, zero ignored.
- `cargo test --workspace --doc --all-features --locked --offline`: completed successfully; no documentation examples currently exist, so no doc-test coverage is inferred.
- Owned workspace formatting and `git diff --check`: pass.

Compiler machine-applicable suggestions were reviewed; remaining lint was corrected structurally rather than globally allowed. All existing tests remain. Native tests use isolated local fixtures where appropriate; they are not production endpoint or real updater evidence. Core release WASM was separately rebuilt successfully through the Web build script; real browser acceptance must execute on an authorized browser runner because this local environment blocks browser navigation by policy.

The one-time formatting workflow is removed after completing its purpose. Steady CI keeps all mandatory independent lanes and adds a single second run after a successful unchanged-main push. It does not recurse on dispatch and cannot certify a different revision.

Remote publication and CI results must be checked against the actual resulting immutable revision. Release-ready stays false; content-data-plane retirement, security, Web/Desktop runtime, deployment and real signed upgrades remain separate requirements.
